In this package you can observe a lot of framework's features at work, by simple but effective examples

### Example 1
The simple one, basic features of the framework, simple Content Analyzer configuration and a ready-to-go Centroid Vector recommender.

### Example 2
More complex features, like rating score combiner, search index activation and tf-idf computation.

### Example 3
Most advanced one, with a focus on the evaluation procedure, comparing two recommenders with some ranking metrics like NDCG.

### Example 4
Focus on a graph based recommender using Page Rank algorithm for both graph feature selection and recommendation algorithm.
